## About
Like its name suggests, Mafia Moderator acts as a moderator for the game of Mafia, allowing the user to select the number of players in each role, entering the names for each player, randomly assigning a role to each player, and facilitating the night and voting phase. The program was written in Swift, using storyboard, UIKit, and SwiftUI.
